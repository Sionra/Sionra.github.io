Thing to do for the Weather App

- put more detail newar humidity ( Precipitation and Wind ), need to change the API call for that
- Still do some CSS to make it look a little like the exemple i use ( Google when you search weather )
- Maybe try to add a Fareinheit too when we click on a button for it
- add icone for the season ( it will be a JS function with some aproximate date, or something more advanced that automattically fetch some official ressources )
- Find a way to put a location name based on the `Long` and `Lat`
